## data json

This file appears in a racetrack generated by AirSimInterface.

> `data`: list - each element of this list is one recorded frame from the simulation.
> `image_name`: string - name of image file in left_image, right_image, and depth_image folder without file ending
> `time_stamp`: int - AirSim simulation timestamp at which this frame was recorded (pausing simulation will not influence this timestamp).
> `waypoint_index`: int - index of waypoint in config.json, which was targeted by PID controller at this frame
> `pose`: list(float) - [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz], exact pose of drone in simulation (NED) in world frame
> `body_velocity_yaw_pid`: list(float) - [vx, vy, vz, vyaw] in meters/radians, local body frame FLU, last velocity command output of PID controller
> `imu`: list() - list of imu recordings, each with timestamp, angular velocity, linear acceleration, and orientation
