## AirSimController 
This is the documentation for _'AirSimController.py'_.  
This class connects to the AirSim API and provides helper functions to controll a multirotor in simulation and to create a structured data set. It is configured with _'config.json'_ and can be extended to add the execution of a mission to the simulation. 

`.configFile`: contains the file handle to the _'config.json'_ congiguration file.  
`.config`: type ConfigLoader(), first level of configuration key value pairs will be loaded as attributes of this object, lower levels will be available as dictionaries or lists  
`.client`: AirSim client handle to MultirotorClient API  
`.DATASET_NAME`: name of data set that will be generated by this object  
`.DATASET_PATH_SUPER`: root folder of dataset  
`.DATASET_PATH`: root path of current race track in dataset folder  
`.DATASET_PATH_FILE`: data file of current race track, this will contain mapping of images and waypoints, and will hold the ground truth information collected from the simulation  
`.DATASET_PATH_LEFT`: path to folder containing images from left camera  
`.DATASET_PATH_RIGHT`: path to folder containing images from right camera  
`.DATASET_PATH_DEPTH`: path to folder containing images from depth camera  
`.outputFile`: file handle of data file of current race track
