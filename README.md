## AirSimController
Controller class, holding connections to airsim  
inherit from this class to create a client (as in SimClient.py).

## AirSim Settings
'settings.json' file has to be placed in ~/Documents/AirSim .  
use e.g. ln -s ~/dev/data-gen/settings.json ~/Documents/AirSim/settings.json to create symlink, such that 'settings.json' is always the same as the version in this repo.
